# bloodbank-php-project
Blood Bank website created using HTML,CSS and Js as front-end languages and Backend is created with PHP.
This is a real life problem based website which works for two user one is blood reciever and other is Hospital staff.
Login and Register forms I've created using MySQL and they are in full working condition.
Main page is created like if anyone get into the website and he wants to click any button the website redirect them to the login page.
There are two option on login page whichever option he/she will opt his/her entry will check in my database and result them that is it valid data or invalid.
If you provide valid data as reciever he can request blood there.
If you provide valid data as hospital staff he can add blood there and review the requests for asking blood.

But for now these two request and add method is not complete but although working.

You can use this project for your college project or school project just keep in mind few things:
create your own database and table and update the database and table name in the login and register form php code check your column names too.

Leave a comment if you're having any problem.
